Associated Tasks: Classification, Causal-Discovery

A complex modern Ultrasound manufacturing, assembly and testing process is normally under consistent surveillance via the monitoring of signals/variables collected from sensors and or
process measurement points. 
Almost all of these signals are equally valuable in a specific monitoring, Assembly & testing system. 
The measured signals contain a combination of useful information, irrelevant information as well as noise. It is often the case that useful information is buried in the latter two.

A large number of vendors, suppliers are involving in the manufacturing and assembly of the devices.

objective:
â€¢	To save the manufacturing time and cost, Reduce the number of testing points (currently it is more than 550, Target to reduce it at-least  140.) 
Important: - After reduction of Testing points 587 to 75, the assembly line will be redesign to save money without significant compromise in quality.
